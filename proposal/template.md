# Project Title

SYNema Detective

## Project Participants

* Arlie Jackson, Martin Chapman
* agjackson, chapmanmartind
* Project do-ers (we will work together on code and report writing)

## Project Description

One paragraph description of your project. Summarize the following:

The goal of "SYNema Detective" is to identify the video streaming service associated with a given network flow, based on the first 10 SYN packets. Because streaming services generate unique patterns in their network traffic, correctly classifying the service from early packets can help improve network traffic analysis, QoS optimizations, and privacy considerations.

This project related to the themes of the course because I will be using packet-level data and applying ML models to classify them. 

Related work includes Bronzino et al. The main goal is to reproduce their results and demonstrate that even with limited packet data, classification is possible.

## Data

* I will use the dataset that is linked on the nPrint site

## Deliverables

* I intend to turn in a jupyter notebook with my model and a project report to present my results and explain my code.
