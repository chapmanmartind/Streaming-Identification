This project identifies the video streaming service associated with a given network flow based on the first 10 SYN packets. 
Because streaming services generate unique patterns in their network traffic correctly classifying the service from early packets can help improve network traffic analysis, QoS optimizations, and privacy considerations.

Related work includes Bronzino et al. This work reproduces their results and demonstrates that even with limited packet data, classification is possible.
